### CracklePop

A very simple implementation.

Clone to a location on your machine and navigate into the folder.

To run from the terminal, run:

```node
 node -e 'require("./crackler").cracklePop()'
```

The function will accept non-negative numbers. It will throw for non-numbers and negative numbers.
